					==> Installation Manual for UniServer <== 

	1. XAMPP is a release made available by the non-profit project Apache Friends. 
	   Versions with PHP 5.5, 5.6, or 7 are available for download on the Apache Friends website.
	2. Once the software bundle has been downloaded, you can start the installation by double clicking on the file with the ending .exe.
	3. After you’ve opened the .exe file (after deactivating your antivirus program(s) and taken note of the User Account Control, 
	   the start screen of the XAMPP setup wizard should appear automatically. Click on ‘Next’ to configure the installation settings.
	4. Under ‘Select Components’, you have the option to exclude individual components of the XAMPP software bundle from the installation. 
	   But for a full local test server, we recommend you install using the standard setup and all available components. After making your choice, click ‘Next’.
	5. In this next step, you have the chance to choose where you’d like the XAMPP software packet to be installed.
	   If you opt for the standard setup, then a folder with the name XAMPP will be created under C:\ for you. After you’ve chosen a location, click ‘Next’.
	6. Once all the aforementioned preferences have been decided, click to start the installation. 
	   The setup wizard will unpack and install the selected components and save them to the designated directory. This process can take several minutes in total. 
	   You can follow the progress of this installation by keeping an eye on the green loading bar in the middle of the screen.
	7. Once all the components are unpacked and installed, you can close the setup wizard by clicking on ‘Finish’.
	   Click to tick the corresponding check box and open the XAMPP Control Panel once the installation process is finished.
